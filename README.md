This is my SEA project.

It is an interface for local residents to interact on a 'Blog' with eachother, and their neighbours to share local information, and events. 
It also doubles as a way for the residents to create and view their council tax bill.
Upon registration, they will be redirected to their profile, there they can choose to change their details, including a profile picture. 
The Navigation Bar includes direct links to 'My bills' and 'Create a Post' that can only be accessed upon logging in.
The homepage also doubles the page for the blog, ordered in oldest to newest so that admin updates can remain on top.
Users can create, update and delete a post.
On 'My bills' they can view their bills, if there are no current bills, it will redirect them to a form to create a bill where they input their address, amount due, etc. These can be changed.

Enjoy.
